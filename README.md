# Education-Life-Expectancy-Project
**A statistical analysis of the correlation between education level and life expectancy (language: R)**

How important is a good education? While numerous studies have proved that higher levels of education lead to higher income, I wanted to analyze the direct relationship between education and life expectancy. In essence, does a prolonged education correlate with living a longer life? My initial hypothesis would be that higher levels of literacy rate/education will be positively correlated to life expectancy since a higher income should lead to living a longer life. Having a higher income means access to better healthcare/medical services along with healthier and higher-quality foods, both of which can increase life expectancy. In this project, I will use the World Bank Development Indicators to answer this question. The World Bank Development Indicators include development indicators for every country compiled from officially recognized international sources. Specifically, the variables I will be examining are SP.DYN.LE00.IN (life expectancy at birth in years), SE.ADT.LITR.ZS (percentage of population ages 15 and above who can both read and write with understanding a short simple statement about their everyday life), SE.SEC.CUAT.UP.ZS (percentage of population ages 25 and above who have attained upper secondary education), and SE.TER.CUAT.BA.ZS (percentage of population ages 25 and above who have attained a Bachelor’s or equivalent).
